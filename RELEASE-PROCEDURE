HOW TO RELEASE TCSH

1)  Update version number and date in patchlevel.h
2)  Note the new version and date in Fixes
3)  Update tcsh.man to have the new version and date also
    (two separate lines, with the date in different formats)
4)  Update the version in configure.in
5)  Update README to have the new version
6)  Commit changes into CVS
7)  run autoreconf
8)  Commit changes into CVS
9)  run make check
10) Tag the release with TCSHx_yy_zz where
	x  == REV
	yy == VERS
	zz == PATCHLEVEL
    from patchlevel.h (the new values you picked)
	

The following steps are now automated by running

    ./MAKERELEASE x yy zz

11) Export the code using the new tag you created.  Rename
    the directory from "tcsh" to "tcsh-x.yy.zz" and create
    tcsh-x.yy.zz.tar.gz
12) Export the previous release as well
13) Remove files that should not be in a release:
    - Announce*
    - MAKERELEASE
    - Makefile.ADMIN
    - RELEASE-PROCEDURE (this file)
14) Generate a "diff -urN" between the two directories you
    have exported, save it in patchz.gz (z is PATCHLEVEL)

The rest are still manual:

15) Make the patch and the source tarball available on ftp
16) Add the new version to bugs.gw.com:
    - Click: Manage > Manage Projects > tcsh
    - Scroll down to "Versions"
    - Click: Edit next to the HEAD version
    - Change the Version from HEAD to the newly released version
    - Change the "Date Order" to the current time
    - Check the Released box
    - Click: Update Version
    - Type HEAD into the box at the bottom of the version list and
      click on "Add and Edit Version"
    - Set the "Date Order" to 2030-01-01 (i.e. far in the future)
    - Click: Update Version
17) Update the version on http://www.tcsh.org/MostRecentRelease
18) Mail an announcement to tcsh@mx.gw.com
